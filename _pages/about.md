To those who stumble here. Hey! I am Sunil, a Master's student at Georgia Tech. My research primarily focuses on 3D Computer Vision. I am interested in the intersection of 3D Perception and Autonomous driving. 

Currently I am working with [Yongsheng Chen](https://ce.gatech.edu/directory/person/yongsheng-chen) and [Cedric Pradalier](https://research.gatech.edu/cedric-pradalier) on problems relating to 3D reconstruction of Hyperspectral Imaging environments. 

Feel free to contact me via email if you want to discuss a collaboration or just a friendly chat :)
